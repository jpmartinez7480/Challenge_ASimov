# Dancing with Death

### **Description**
This application is part of the challenge "Dancing with Death" for Asimov Consultores. The backend was developed using Lumen, a micro-framework for PHP based on Laravel. I used a docker container to install all the necessary dependencies. For that, I used the following github: https://github.com/lephleg/laravel-lumen-docker. The data is saved in a MySQL 5.7 database.
The frontend was developed using Vuejs and Vuetify.
